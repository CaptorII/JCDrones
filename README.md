# JCDrones - Drone Project
Interface for connecting with a swarm of drones through a Django interactive website. 
To get started, use command
```
python manage.py runserver
```
In your browser, go to [127.0.0.1:8000/drones](http://127.0.0.1:8000/drones)

Select 'Register' and type in a username and password, then you'll be redirected back to the home page.

Select 'Login' and type in your username and password, then you'll be taken to the dashboard.

From here you can use the buttons to navigate the dashboard, create a swarm and drones from defaults, or navigate to the other tabs to create custom drones with different IPs, or update the details of existing drones.
